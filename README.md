# TCSCL (Turing Complete Systems for Compute Languages)
**TCSCL** is a low-level, Turing complete programming language designed to run on OpenCL-compatible GPUs. It offers a minimalist syntax for performing fundamental operations such as arithmetic, logical functions, and loops, while allowing users to define and call functions.

## Key Features
- **GPU-Optimized**: Runs on OpenCL 1.2+ compatible GPUs for high-performance computing.
- **Modular Compiler**: Easily extendable with new instructions for future growth.
